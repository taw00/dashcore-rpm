# dash.conf
# This is a Dash Core Wallet / Full-node / Masternode configuration file.
#
# If you run dashd, dash-qt, dash-cli as a normal user, the expected location
# of this file will be $HOME/.dashcore/dash.conf
#
# If you run dashd as a systemd managed service as configured by the service
# definition files installed by this package, dash.conf is expected to be
# located in /etc/dashcore/
#
# IMPORTANT: Ensure you change the rpcuser and rpcpassword before using this!
# https://github.com/taw00/dashcore-rpm for more information.
#
# If unchanged after RPM package installation, there will be a set of
# "typical" settings enabled at the tail end of this file. Adjust as
# needed.


#
# Network-related settings:
#

# Run on 1=testnet, 0=mainnet (mainnet is default package setting)
#testnet=0

# Run dashd as a daemon (in the background)
#daemon=1

# Run a regression test network
#regtest=0

# Connect via a SOCKS5 proxy
#proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

# Bind to given address and always listen on it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6
#bind=<addr>

# Bind to given address and whitelist peers connecting to it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6
#whitebind=<addr>

##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
##    they can connect to you.                              ##
##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
##                                                          ##
##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##

# Use as many addnode= settings as you like to connect to specific peers

# Mainnet

#connect=10.0.0.1:9999
# Testnet
#connect=10.0.0.1:19999

# Listening mode (allow any peer -another node- to connect), enabled by
# default except when "connect" is being used. listen=0 means that this node
# is not fully participatory with the network.
#listen=1

#
# JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running dashd process)
#

# server=1 enables RPC and tells dash-qt and dashd to accept JSON-RPC commands
# (set by default if not specified)
#server=1

# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Use [host]:port
# notation for IPv6.  This option can be specified multiple times (default:
# bind to all interfaces)
#rpcbind=<addr>

# How many seconds dash will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request.
# after the HTTP connection is established. 
#rpctimeout=30

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.
# Specify as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from
# other hosts, either as a single IPv4/IPv6 or with a subnet specification.
#
# NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is
# NOT RECOMMENDED, because the rpcpassword is transmitted over the network
# unencrypted.

#rpcallowip=10.1.1.34/255.255.255.0
#rpcallowip=1.2.3.4/24
#rpcallowip=2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334/96

# Listen for RPC connections on this TCP port
# (by default, set to 9998 or 19998 dependent on testnet=0 or 1 setting)
#rpcport=9998

# You can use dashd to send commands to dashd running on another host using

# Miscellaneous options
#

# Pre-generate this many public/private key pairs, so wallet backups will be
# valid for both prior transactions and several dozen future transactions.
# In order to enable privatesend, 1000 is the default.
#keypool=1000

# If off, wallet-specific RPC calls will be disallowed (default: 0)
#disablewallet=0

# Prepend debug output with timestamp (default: 1) 
#logtimestamps=1

# Indicate alternative data directory location
# The default datadir setting is $HOME/.dashcore - We override
# that here for administrators running dashd as a systemd service
# (configuration file in /etc/dashcore/dash.conf and the service started
# with systemctl).  Only commands and nodes referencing this configuration
# file or managing dashd via systemctl will use this datadir by default.
#datadir=$HOME/.dashcore
#datadir=/var/lib/dashcore


#
# Transaction fee configuration...
#

# Send transactions as zero-fee transactions if possible (default: 0)
#sendfreetransactions=0

# Create transactions that have enough fees (or priority) so they are likely to
# begin confirmation within n blocks (default: 1).
# This setting is overridden by the -paytxfee option.
#txconfirmtarget=n

# Pay an optional transaction fee every time you send dash.  Transactions with
# fees are more likely than free transactions to be included in generated
# blocks, so may be validated sooner.
#paytxfee=0.00


#
# User interface options
#

# Start Dash minimized
#min=1

# Minimize to the system tray

#
# Masternode settings

# Is this a masternode? 
# Shared secret between the Masternode and the colateralizing wallet. The

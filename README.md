# Dash for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux<br />_...wallet, node, and masternode_

**Dash (Digital Cash)** is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that
offers instant transactions _**(InstantSend)**_, private transactions
***(PrivateSend)*** and token fungibility. Dash operates a decentralized
governance and budgeting system, making it the first decentralized autonomous
organization (DAO). Dash is also a platform for innovative decentralized
crypto-tech.

Dash is open source and the name of the overarching project. Learn more

This github repository is used to develop and maintain Dash natively built
and packaged for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The source packages are housed directly within this repository. For more about
the source packages and build instructions, please visit this link:
<https://github.com/taw00/dashcore-rpm/blob/master/README.source.md>

**Binary (executable) RPMs are pre-built for you (from these sources) and are
available through external repositories that your packaging system can
understand.** This makes deploying and maintaining Dash on a Fedora, CentOS, or
RHEL system dependable, more secure, and oh so very simple. This is arguably
the simplest way to deploy and manage a Dash Wallet, Node, or Masternode. For
more about the available binary RPMs, please visit this link:

### Disclaimer!

These packages are built and tested. But just like with cryptocurrency, you
must assume the risk associated to this space. I only claim that I made a best
effort to build packages that work and function as expected. They may not in
your context. Additionally, these packages are built from code provided by the
Dash community. I have zero control over any vulnerabilities that code may
contain. Please test your configation thoroughly before associating significant
sums of money. Dash carefully!

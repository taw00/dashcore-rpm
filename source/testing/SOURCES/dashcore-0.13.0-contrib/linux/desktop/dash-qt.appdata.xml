    <p>Dash (Digital Cash) is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with
       a strong focus on serving the payments industry. Dash offers a form of
       money that is portable, inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be
       spent securely both online and in person with minimal transaction
       fees. Dash offers instant transactions (InstantSend), private
       transactions (PrivateSend), and operates a self-governing and
       self-funding model. This decentralized governance and budgeting
       system makes it one of the first ever successful decentralized
       autonomous organizations (DAO). Dash is also a platform for
       innovative decentralized crypto-tech.</p>

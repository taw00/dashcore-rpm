  cryptocurrency that offers instant transactions (InstantSend), private
  transactions (PrivateSend) and token fungibility.
  
  A Dash Full Node is a un-collatoralized member of a decentralized network of
  servers that validate transactions and blocks. A Dash Masternode is a member
  of a network of incentivized servers that perform expanded critical services

  network and is used to test experimental features and functionality with test
  currency (tDash).</description>
